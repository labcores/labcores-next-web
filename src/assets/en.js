  ABOUT_1: 'More than entertainment or learning, through social media, we can identify unprecedented levels of citizen engagement and participation. This activity is called “participatory sensing” or “citizen sensing”. Moreover, sensors are embedded into our everyday environment, such as cars, micro-chipped animals, elevators, smart buildings, environmental monitors and others. Many people are now carrying some form of sensor-laden device - a mobile phone, a tablet, a fitness device - from which sensor readings can also be retrieved. In this case, people interact – direct and indirect – with sensors. This is called ‘human-in-the-loop sensing’, empowering the citizen sensing with new kind of data. In citizen sensing, a sensor is not necessarily a hardware sensor, but can be a virtual sensor or a human interpreting sensory data. This data explosion has resulted in the emerging topic of “Big Social Data”. Big Social Data refers to large data volumes that relate to people interactions (with other people or things) or describe their behaviors, needs, and patterns. This data generates a cycle of knowledge creation, which can be useful to resolve problems in urban centers. From this social interaction, we can create more accurate knowledge about the city and its dynamics to support monitoring, surveillance and decision-making tasks of various kinds.',

Users can detect new events, help in dealing with natural disasters, diseases, terrorism, and understand the political scenario and support public manifestations. Citizens consume and share information about their cities - such as problems, events, ideas, suggestions, criticisms, and demands – acting as ‘human sensors’, forming opinions and participating in the city evolution. This activity is called “participatory sensing” or “citizen sensing”, a form of citizen participation in environmental monitoring and action which is bottom-up, empowering a community. ',

Real-time mining of indirectly self-reported and sousveillance information harvested from social media can offer useful data and insights about unfolding trends and emerging crowd behaviors, especially at times of crises. However, such data often contain variable amounts of “noise”, misinformation and bias (which can get further “amplified” through the viral nature of social media) and usually require some advanced forms of filtering and verification by both machine-based algorithms and human experts before becoming reliable enough for use in decision-making tasks. Eradicating these issues or lessening their effect can be accomplished by verification of data with other sensor nodes, but depends on the density of the network and existence of other related data.',

  PROJECT_COVID_TITLE:'O impacto do virtual no real: Como o uso das redes sociais online impactaram a epidemia de COVID-19 no Brasil?',
  PROJECT_COVID_TEXT: 'Mais do que entretenimento ou aprendizado, através das mídias sociais, podemos identificar níveis sem precedentes de engajamento e participação dos cidadãos. Esta atividade é chamada de ?sensoriamento participativo? ou ?sensoriamento-cidadão?. No sensoriamento participativo, um sensor não é necessariamente um hardware, mas pode ser um sensor virtual ou um humano interpretando dados sensoriais. Partindo da premissa de que os cidadãos utilizam as mídias sociais para relatar problemas, divulgar eventos, emitir opiniões e transmitir informações que julgam relevantes, tais informações podem ajudar no sensoriamento virtual e criar um conhecimento mais preciso sobre a cidade. Nesta proposta de projeto, cuja duração é de um ano, visamos comparar o impacto da COVID-19 no Brasil no cenário real ? como casos, óbitos, vacinação e o isolamento social ? com o cenário virtual. A principal questão de pesquisa é ?O engajamento nas mídias sociais refletiu ou impactou o comportamento real dos cidadãos brasileiros durante a epidemia de COVID-19??. Para isto, utilizaremos os dados do DATASUS e PCDaS (Plataforma de Ciência de Dados aplicada à Saúde) como fonte de dados do ?mundo real? e dados públicos oriundos das interações sociais no Twitter, Facebook e Instagram para o mapeamento das interações do ?mundo virtual?',

  PROJECT_COVID_TITLE: 'The Impact of the Virtual on the Real: How the Use of Online Social Networks Impacted the COVID-19 Epidemic in Brazil?',
  PROJECT_COVID_TEXT: 'More than just entertainment or learning, through social media, we can identify unprecedented levels of citizen engagement and participation. This activity is called "participatory sensing" or "citizen sensing." In participatory sensing, a sensor is not necessarily hardware but can be a virtual sensor or a human interpreting sensory data. Assuming that citizens use social media to report issues, publicize events, express opinions, and transmit information they deem relevant, such information can aid in virtual sensing and create a more accurate understanding of the city. In this project proposal, which spans one year, we aim to compare the impact of COVID-19 in Brazil in the real scenario—such as cases, deaths, vaccination, and social isolation—with the virtual scenario. The primary research question is, "Did engagement on social media reflect or impact the real behavior of Brazilian citizens during the COVID-19 epidemic?" To do this, we will use data from DATASUS and PCDaS (Data Science Platform applied to Health) as sources of "real-world" data and public data from interactions on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for mapping interactions in the "virtual world."',

PROJECT_CAPES_TITLE: '[CAPES] Digital Technologies for Monitoring, Mapping, and Controlling Outbreaks, Endemics, Epidemics, and Pandemics',
PROJECT_CAPES_TEXT: 'The rapid spread of COVID-19 in the country and the high lethality of confirmed cases are causing great concern and suffering in the population and can lead to a collapse in healthcare services. It is essential, for the effective control of the disease, to understand its space-time diffusion process and its social determinants. Furthermore, knowledge of the magnitude of the epidemic process will support proper planning of healthcare actions for COVID-19 patients. Reducing the growth rate of the disease ("flattening the curve") is an essential goal to be achieved through social isolation, along with forecasting hospital and personnel resources, developing guidelines and public policies for cities and regions of the country, and guiding the appropriate time for the gradual return of social and economic activities. To achieve these objectives, it is essential to collect and process numerous pieces of information that can also determine whether the coping policies adopted are effective, their impact on virus spread, and the timing of returning to activities. However, the impact of the epidemic varies among individuals from different social groups in terms of socioeconomic conditions, ethnic-racial relations, and gender. It is important to consider this information in the analysis, as the correlation of these data with other information collected by state agencies, public hospitals, and universities can identify relevant patterns. A major challenge for coping with the epidemic from the epidemiological modeling standpoint is obtaining reliable information regarding the date of symptoms, symptom severity, case reporting, among various other types of information. In this context, different data sources, including health system data, mobility data, and others, must be aggregated into an integrated repository so that they can be accessed by different research groups in this proposal and by the SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System). This integrated database is already being organized by the Modeling Working Group (GT) at UFRJ. It is essential for generating an innovation ecosystem in conjunction with the full use of data science and AI resources to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This ever-increasing volume of data requires infrastructure and specific techniques to be adequately processed, making AI, Big Data, Internet of Things, and other instruments that contribute to digital transformation essential in the field of healthcare. One technology influences the other and can even expand its meaning. The combination of different datasets may have varying relevance depending on the source that seeks to understand what they represent, whether it is healthcare organizations, civil society, a specific level of government, and especially research groups that promote Open Science and Open Data.',
